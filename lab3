# Lab Objective: Check a users ID and if they're root then display a message
# saying it's insecure to run this script as root. If they are not root then
# get their home directory from the /etc/password file and display the size
# of the contents of it.
#
# 1. Get the users ID
# 2. Exit if the user is root
# 3. If the user is not root make sure their userid is larger than 500
# 4. Check to see if /etc/password exists and is readable
# 5. Get the users home directory from /etc/passwd
# 6. Display the size of their home directory
